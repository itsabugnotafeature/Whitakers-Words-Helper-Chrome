# Whitakers-Words-Helper-Chrome

This extension uses the wonderful site designed by the late William Whitaker, to bring detailed and accurate Latin definitions to your fingertips.

To use it all you have to do is double click on any word you want to look up and the definition will appear below. If you would like to look up multiple words at once, you can either double click and drag, or highlight multiple words, right click on the selection and choose 'Get Latin Defintions'.

This extension will be available on the Chrome App Store shortly, under the same name, by the developer FullBlown.

If you can't wait, you can download the files and use it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. To do this, first download the file. Then navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions). In the upper right, click the slider to turn on Developer mode. In the upper left, click 'Load Unpacked Extension', navigate to the folder, and click select. The extension is now available. You will have to reload any tabs you opened previously.

The source code for this is available to all.
